# AboutMe
I'm 15 yeas old developer

I like java as programming language (as you can see in my projects) 

I'm proud contributor to [SlimeFun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) project by [BetterReactor](https://github.com/CAPS123987/Better-Nuclear-Generator) project and [SmallSpace](https://github.com/CAPS123987/SmallSpace)

I also created my own [site](https://hnilicka.jecool.net) so a know bit of html css and javascript
